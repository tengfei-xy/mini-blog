> XS$NULL is created when the database component Oracle XML Database (XDB) is installed. It is an internal account that represents the absence of a user in a session. This is used by the lightweight session infrastructure (APEX and XDB make use of this) and the name of this user is hard coded in those modules that use lightweight sessions. As such, XS$NULL must exist in the database. Note that because XS$NULL is not really a user, this account can only be accessed by the Oracle Database instance. XS$NULL does not have any privilege and no one can authenticate as XS$NULL, nor can authentication credentials ever be assigned to XS$NULL. This account is dropped when XDB is deinstalled.
